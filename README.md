# OBESITY PREDICTION (RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM)

# Project Description

A Machine Learning Model to predict OBESITY of a patient. This project uses RandomForestClassifier Model to train on a given dataset. Interactive GUI is developed using PyQt6.

The file [description.txt](description.txt) contains insights and description of each and every variable in dataset.

The dataset used is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhramasaputra/obesity-based-on-eating-habits-and-physical-cond

# Implementation of Requests
## Requirements and Setup
1. Python Modules: We have listed all the necessary Python modules in the requirements.txt file. This includes PyQt6 for the GUI, Pandas for data handling, and Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
2. Virtual Environment: We have utilized the venv module to create an isolated Python environment. This ensures that our project dependencies are managed efficiently and do not conflict with system-wide Python packages.
3. Data Source: We sourced our data from a freely available dataset, which can be found on platforms such as Kaggle. The data is in CSV format, suitable for import and analysis.

## Data Handling and Analysis
1. Data Import: The application allows users to import data via a menu button. Additionally, data loading is also available directly upon starting the application.
2. Data Analysis with Pandas: We have integrated Pandas methods to provide an overview of the dataset. This includes the use of dataframe.info(), dataframe.describe(), and dataframe.corr() methods.
3. Additional Metrics and Diagrams: Besides the basic Pandas methods, we also implemented other metrics and diagrams to enhance data analysis and visualization.

## User Interaction and Machine Learning
1. Input Widgets: Our application features several input widgets (at least 3, with 2 being different types) that allow users to modify feature variables.
2. Machine Learning Algorithm: We have applied a Scikit-learn training model algorithm, particularly one inspired by Aurélien Géron's work in Chapter 4 of his book.
3. Output Canvas: For data visualization, we created 1 or 2 output canvases. These display the results of data analysis and predictions in a user-friendly manner.
4. Statistical Metrics: At least 3 statistical metrics are displayed based on the input data, providing insights into the dataset's characteristics.
5. Interactive Predictions: The application is designed to be interactive. Changes in input parameters trigger new predictions and visualizations, enhancing the user experience and making the tool more dynamic.
